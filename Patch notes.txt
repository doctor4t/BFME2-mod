// TODO, finish implementing call for allies research and summons for each camp
// TODO, make wild lairs harder (super large wandering radius, more ennemies...)
// IDEA: Swarm, transform Gollum into a timed entity --> on death, create a swarm pit (wild lair that can only be destroyed by ring heroes and keeps summoning swarm goblin hordes (better damaging goblins?))
